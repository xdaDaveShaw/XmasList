This is an application I've written to go along with my [Blog Post][1] for the F# Advent Calendar 2018.

## Developing

- To get started clone the repository and run the `build.cmd` or `build.sh` script fetch all the dependencies and bundle the site.
- Open the Repo in VS Code and run the "Build Task" (Ctrl + Shift + B)
- Now run the "Test Task" to set all the tests running in Watch Mode.
- Browse to http://localhost:8080 to see the running site.
